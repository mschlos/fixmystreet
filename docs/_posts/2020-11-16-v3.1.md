I hope you are all okay with the ongoing situations around the world. We are
happy to release **version 3.1**, with some new features and bugfixes.

### Front end improvements

A random assortment of improvements to the front end, including aerial maps for
Bing and OSM maps, lazy image loading on list items, the ability to check
passwords against Have I Been Pwned, and Open Location Codes support in the
search box.

### Admin improvements

We've added a full text index so searching reports in the admin should be much
quicker. You can disable updates or reopening on a per-category basis, as well
as enable anonymous reporting. CSV generation is now done asynchronously, with
progress shown, in case it takes a long time. Staff users can use HTML in
updates, and response templates can also include HTML. The site now records
whether a report was made on desktop or mobile, and includes any extra fields
in email submissions to bodies. Staff status can be removed from users in bulk,
and inspectors can update the asset on a report via the inspector form.

### Bugfixes

As always, a wide variety of issues covered here. We added PostgreSQL 12
compatibility to the schema update script, fixed an issue where the CSV export
returned multiple entries per row, added a fix for photo orientation in modern
browsers, and improved the moderation diff display.

### Upgrading

A full list of changes can be seen in the
[changelog](https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/releases/tag/v3.1) as usual.
