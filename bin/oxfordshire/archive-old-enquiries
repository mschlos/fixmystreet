=head DESCRIPTION

This is for bulk closing reports, based either on age, or on a list of reports.

If you pass `--reports` with a csv file of report IDs in the first column it will
close all reports with that id. All reports before `--closure-cutoff` will have alerts
suppressed.

If you pass `--email-cutoff` and `--closure-cutoff` then all reports older than
email-cutoff will be closed and an email sent to the user, and all reports older
than closure-cutoff will be closed with no email.
