    <h2>How to use our FixMyStreet pages</h2>

<p>After entering a location, you are presented with a map of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area, or report others yourself by clicking on the map at the location of the problem.

<h3>Problems zoom out on the reporting map</h3>

<p>We want to keep FixMyStreet locally focused, so we restrict the ability to move radically between areas. 

<h3>Inappropriate content</h3>
