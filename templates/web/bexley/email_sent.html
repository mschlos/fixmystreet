        <strong>While we find ourselves in these unprecedented times.</strong>
        All issues reported on Bexleyâ€™s FixMyStreet system will continue to be
        actioned to keep our roads safe for critical workers to be able to continue
        to support the London Borough of Bexley and its residents. We may take
        longer to respond to you while we concentrate on getting issues resolved in
        priority order and within available resources. Non-urgent defects may also
        take longer than normal to fix. We will continue to serve you the best that
        we can but urge everyone not to make journeys unless absolutely necessary
        and not report to anything that is not urgent. Thank you for
        your&nbsp;understanding.
